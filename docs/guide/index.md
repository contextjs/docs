# Welcome to ContextJS

**ContextJS** is a modern, fully object-oriented framework for building scalable TypeScript-based applications. It provides a clean, composable foundation built around:

- Dependency Injection
- Compiler Extensions
- Lifecycle-aware Services
- High-Performance Web Servers
- Tooling with the `ctx` CLI

Whether you're building a microservice, CLI tool, or a full-stack system, ContextJS gives you the flexibility and performance to scale with confidence.

## Why ContextJS?

- **Full OOP**: Embrace encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism—without fighting the runtime.
- **Modular Ecosystem**: Use only the packages you need.
- **Type Safety First**: Every public API is fully typed and JSDoc-documented.
- **Compiler-Aware**: Extend TypeScript with custom AST transformers.
- **100% Tested**: Every package ships with full test coverage and clean error handling.
